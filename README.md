# Summer-2025-Colorado-STV-Research
This code was written and used to simulate STV elections in the State House using Colorado voter data. It was written by Nora Nelson Laird, Iris Pixler, and Katherine Rodbell, under faculty advisor Beth Malmskog at Colorado College. The paper produced as a result of the research project for which this code was written can be found at [link pending], which contains more details on our research goals and process. If you're here from reading our paper, thanks for checking it out!

The files contained in this repository are:
-  chain creation.py, to generate a chain
-  STV from chain, to run elections from a generated chain
- 22583_table.csv, data from the 2022 colorado AG election we used
- dem_results.csv, a file generated by our chain used in our elections. use this one, or generate your own with chain creation.py
- rep_results.csv, a file generated by our chain used in our elections. use this one, or generate your own with chain creation.py

Packages used in our code that are required installations are:
- VoteKit, developed by the Data and Democracy Lab (as cited in our paper)
- Gerrychain, developed by the Data and Democracy Lab (as cited in our paper)
- several other minor packages, listed imported at the top of our .py files - install what you do not have
